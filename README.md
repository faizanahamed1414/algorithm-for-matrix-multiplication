# algorithm-for-matrix-multiplication
This is my first Github repository. In this we can multiply two matrix of A of order R*C and B of order r*c. it follow basic rules of matrix
in this Project we ask user to give matrix value and store it in A and B.
where, A and B both are Matrix of order RxC. Where order also define by user.
we want to optimize this code and able to do multiplication more then two matrix.
which follow all rules of matrix
